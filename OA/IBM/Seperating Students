There are a number of students standing in a single file line. Each student is numbered sequentially from 0. Each student also has a binary digit associated with them, where 0 indicate the student's performance is above average and 1 indicates the student's performance is below average.
The teacher wants to groupe the sudent by performance opposite ends of the line such that the number of adjacent pairs of students where one student is a 0 and the other student is a 1 minimized. To accomplish this, any student can swap places in line with the student located immediately in front of or behind them. Each time a pair of student swap places, it counts as a move. Determine the minimum number of moves needed to create and optimal configuration.

For example, there are n=4 students arranged as avg=[0,1,0,1]. With 1 move, switching students 1 and 2, we get the array [0,0,1,1] which is optimal.
